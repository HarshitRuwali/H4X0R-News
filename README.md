# H4X0R-News
 An iOS/ MacOS/ iPadOS news app which fetch current trending tech news from web, made using the whole new SwiftUI.<br/>
 Since the app uses the UIKIT, you can literally build and run the app on your iPhone or Mac or iPad, just by checking up a couple of check boxes.<br/>
The api which I am using is free and you dont even to register for an api. You can just clone the repo and run the app.<br/>
The website for api: https://hn.algolia.com/api and I am using the current stories api. <br/>
